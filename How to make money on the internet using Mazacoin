How to make Money on the Internet with MazaCoin

Develop a product or service
  I now believe that everyone should have at least one personal product for sale online.  It is best if this product is linked to something
  that you are passionate about.  If you have done your market research, this product or service fills a need or solves a problem.
  
?Profit
  Now that you have a product, How much do you need to charge for it?  How much does it cost to repoduce it?  An eBook is a great start.
  
  There was a pizza sold for 10,000 Bitcoin very early in Bitcoin's history.  If you sold only part of that stash to pay for expenses 
  and held on to some of the rest it is worth much more.
  
Get a website
There are a few places on the Internet to get a inexpensive website where you can sell your brand.

Use a payment processor?
  CoinPayments is great for accepting several forms of payments.  I like that they accept MazaCoin especially.

  I like using Encompass to hold my MazaCoin
Using Exchanges
