Chapter 2

== 1...2...3...?Profit 
Now that you have a product or service, How much do you need to charge for it? How much does it cost to repoduce it? An eBook is a great start.  It cost nothing to reproduce, so you can charge less for it and get more purchases.

You can look at this another way.  Holdig on to a bit of undervalued Crypto-currencies could be profitable.

There was a pizza sold for 10,000 Bitcoin very early in Bitcoin's history.  If you sold only part of that stash to pay for expenses and held on to the rest as profit, the Bitcoin would be worth thousands today at $350 a piece.

This is a good reason to sell items for mazacoin and keep a little for profit.  Another way to look at it.  I often say I wish everyone in China could send me a penny.  2 Billion times .01 equals 20 Million.
