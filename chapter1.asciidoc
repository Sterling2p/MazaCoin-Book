Develop a product or service
  I now believe that everyone should have at least one personal product for sale online.  It is best if this product is linked to something that you are passionate about.  If you have done your market research, this product or service fills a need or solves a problem.
  There are probably several things that you feel passionate or drawn to.  Look for where they intersect.  There is a product or service in that area.
