chapter 1
Develop a product or service
  I now believe that everyone should have at least one personal product for sale online.  It is best if this product is linked to something that you are passionate about.  If you have done your market research, this product or service fills a need or solves a problem. 
  There are probably several things that you feel passionate about or drawn to.  Look for where they intersect.  There is a product or service in that area.  Today, in 2015, you can get a lot of answers to your daily questions by just "Asking Google", We can take this a step farther to the websites that make the Internet the great collection of information that it is.  There is a growing layer of websites that aim to meet the needs of individuals asking questions on the internet and you can build a following that can produce passive income if you provide the answers that you have stumbled across in your life.
  
You also need to get an e-mail list.  This is a list of people who have given you permission to contact them about your content.  The best way is to earn their interest into trusting you with their e-mail address.  Your goal is to get 1,000 true fans.  You can generate a good gross income with you 1,000 true fans.  If you only create $100 in products and services a year and those fans buy-in, you have just made $100,000 before paying for your costs!
Make sure you make your content shareable.  Make it easy for people to pass along.
